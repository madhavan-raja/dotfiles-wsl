# Dotfiles

Yes, I prefer WSL over a native Linux install. I like playing my guitar (which I guess you could do on Linux but not well?) or using Photoshop (GIMP doesn't have Generative Fill, and not a big fan of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) unless you can drink it) while my APIs are running in the background. Honestly, I'd much rather prefer an entirely different machine for development so I could take my Windows off of the hypervisor kernel. That's a different story though.

## Installing WSL

Microsoft has a cute [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for this. Just make sure we got version 2.

## Packages

### Helix
[Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) is a modal text editor that is better than Vim. It is also worse than Vim because there's no way it will get the attention that Vim has got over the years. But it's written in Rust, so that makes it the superior editor.

### Zellij
[Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) is a sweet terminal multiplexer. Why do we need it? Because all the cool kids use it and my terminal's vertical split is horrible. Also, it is written in Rust, so that makes it better than Tmux.

### Nushell
[Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) is a word processor. Just kidding, it's a shell. It's object-oriented so everything looks ✨ _c l e a n_ ✨. It is also written in the greatest language ever made---Rust.

### Starship
[Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) is a prompt engine. Anyway who cares, it's written in Rust so it must be good.
